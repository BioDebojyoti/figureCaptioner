# Notes:
# - Suggested Dash app name: "PDF Captionator" â€” a concise, catchy name for a PDF caption adding tool.
# - Install Poppler separately (not in Conda env) because pdf2image relies on it.
#   macOS: brew install poppler
#   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
#   Windows: download from https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows and add to PATH
